# Quasars Probing Galaxy Clusters

An astrophysical coding based project focused on processing quasar spectral data from the [SDSS eBOSS Data Release 14](https://dr15.sdss.org), and combining these results to analyse data from the [Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN (CARLA) Spizter Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0770) in order to study the environments of proto galaxy clusters in the distant Universe. The full project write-up can be found in the Research Project Report pdf file.

## Motivation and Project Aims

Through studying the effect of intervening neutral hydrogen in the spectra of high redshift QSO we have been able to advance current techniques used to understand protoclusters
that coalesce under gravity to form the cosmic structures we see in the universe today. This
project analyses the preceding methods by which these structures have been studied, as well as
detailing a new line of research, first crafted for use in the study of other QSO in the line of sight
to background quasars. This work utilised this quasar probing technique
to study protoclusters by measuring absorption of their neutral hydrogen content in the spectra of
background quasars.

## Example Spectra Stacking Figures

The two figures below visualise the spectral flux stacking method used in this project. Multiple continuum fitted quasar sight line spectra are aligned according the the galaxy cluster's rest frame, and then averaged together in an attempt to find a Lyman alpha absorption signal.
